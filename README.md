Theme by r/RGNano

To use the Minimal RetroFE theme, begin by downloading and extracting its associated ZIP file. 
With the RG Nano mounted to your computer, first copy and paste the generated folder into the /mnt/FunKey/.retrofe/layouts section of the RG Nano file system. 
Next, open the layouts.list file (also located in /mnt/FunKey/.retrofe/layouts) in a text editor and add the name of the theme to the theme list 
(if the themeâ€™s folder is called Retro, for instance, add Retro to the theme list). Once this is done, eject the RG Nano and navigate to the SET THEME section of the RetroFE menu. 
To make the new theme appear on the theme list, switch RetroFE to a different theme than the current one.
